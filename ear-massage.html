 <p>This course is open to massage and physical therapists, nurses and healthcare workers, acupuncturists and people wishing to start a career in acupuncture. While this is a postgraduate course, no previous training in acupuncture is needed to attend. The Ear Pressure Points Stimulation Massage does not require the use of needles.</p>
<p>The ear is one of many reflex systems where the whole body can be represented in a part of the body. Points on the ear can be stimulated by manual pressure and needles, cupping, magnets and ear acupressure pellets.</p>
<p>Experience and research show that Auricular Therapy without needles can be as effective as body acupuncture. Many practitioners have noted their clients’ collective enthusiasm over the technique. As a less invasive and time-consuming method than acupuncture, Ear Pressure Point Massage frequently delivers effective relief for pain, stress and other daily problems.</p>
<p>Our course will teach you all the critical information and techniques you will need to practice this increasingly popular holistic treatment method. You’ll be trained in practical, hands-on workshops to improve your practicing potential and client satisfaction rates.</p>
<p>This technique is easy to learn and apply. It’s particularly effective for patients uncomfortable with needles who still want to enjoy the therapeutic benefits of these practices. Your list of satisfied clients will continue to grow as more referrals are sent to your office.</p>
