 <h2>About Us </h2>
 <p>Our holistic training centre offering training in a wide range of complementary therapies, including Massage, Aromatherapy, Reflexology, Chinese Medicine and lots more.</p>
<p>We are committed to helping all students enjoy their training experience at our School and we have established an excellent reputation for the unique content and quality of our training.</p>
<p>We are delighted to say that a very high percentage of our students return again and again for further courses and we are proud to say it is because of our friendly and focused approach to learning and teaching.</p>
<p>Once qualified, all our diploma students can avail of our principal’s lifetime mentoring of past students. She is always available to help past students with career or client advice, planning new ventures or general support with their practice.</p>
<p>From localised pain relief to relaxation and improved holistic wellness, there are enormous client benefits to regular Swedish Massage. You’ll learn how these benefits can improve your own life (or those of your clients if you’re a practitioner). You will also be introduced to the concept of a Holistic Lifestyle with tools on how to make positive changes that will benefit your health.</p>
<p>Our training room is purpose built and it is bright, fresh and comfortable.</p>
<p>The biggest testimony to the quality of our wellness program is that fact that almost everyone who starts a class at the centre never leaves and classes fill very quickly!</p>
